# Lecture 1: Elements of Combinatorics. /06 Sept. 2021/
The main rules of combinatorics: rule of sum and rule of multiplication. Factorial. Arrangements, Replacements, Combinations, Combinations with repetition. Newton's binomial theorem.


The rule of sum:

Let an object a be from A = {a1, a2, ... an} that could be selected by n dif. ways, and another obj. b from B = {b1, b2, ... bn} could be selected by m ways. Then, there are n+m ways to select an obj. a or an obj. b.

*** Learning sample:

How many ways to select a student in a group consisting of A boys and B girls?

Solution: We may select a student from two cohorts: A (boys) or B (girls). "Or" is the same as "plus", therefore, A + B is the correct answer.


The rule of multiplication:

Let an obj. A would be selected by n ways, and then after such a choice an obj. B would be selected by m ways too. Then, a duet (A,B) could be selected by n*m ways.

*** Learning sample:

It is needed to find a num. of words that contain no more than 3 letters from {A,T,G,C}.

S: "No more than" means "less or equal". In this case, the range of our choice is 1 or 2 or 3 letters: when 1 letter - A, T, G, C; when 2 letters - AA, AT, AG, ... CC; when 3 letters - AAA, AAT, ATT, ... CCC. So, we may write it mathematically as it follows:
4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 = 84 words.
P.S. for instance, 4^1 means number of 1 letter words from 4 possible letters (A,T,G,C), 4^2 - number of 2 letter words from 4 possible letters (AA,AT,AG..), etc.
