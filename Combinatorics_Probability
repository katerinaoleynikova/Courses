The main rules of combinatorics: rule of sum and rule of multiplication. Factorial. Arrangements, Replacements, Combinations, Combinations with repetitions. Newton's binomial theorem.


The rule of sum:

Let an object a be from A = {a1, a2, ... an} that could be selected by n dif. ways, and another obj. b from B = {b1, b2, ... bn} could be selected by m ways. Then, there are n+m ways to select an obj. a or an obj. b.

*** Learning sample:

How many ways to select a student in a group consisting of A boys and B girls?

Solution: We may select a student from two cohorts: A (boys) or B (girls). "Or" is the same as "plus", therefore, A + B is the correct answer.


The rule of multiplication:

Let an obj. A would be selected by n ways, and then after such a choice an obj. B would be selected by m ways too. Then, a duet (A,B) could be selected by n*m ways.

*** Learning sample:

It is needed to find a num. of words that contain no more than 3 letters from {A,T,G,C}.

S: "No more than" means "less or equal". In this case, the range of our choice is 1 or 2 or 3 letters: when 1 letter - A, T, G, C; when 2 letters - AA, AT, AG, ... CC; when 3 letters - AAA, AAT, ATT, ... CCC. So, we may write it mathematically as it follows:
4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 = 84 words.
P.S. for instance, 4^1 means number of 1 letter words from 4 possible letters (A,T,G,C), 4^2 - number of 2 letter words from 4 possible letters (AA,AT,AG..), etc.

*** Learning sample:

How many five-digit numbers do exist?

S: ***** - a five-digit number. The first * can be in the range {1-9}, the other ones - in the range {0,9}. Thus, n = 9*10^4, where n - a number of five-digit num-s.


Dirichlet's principle or Pigeonhole principle:

Let there be n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, then there is at least one pigeonhole w/ 2 or more pigeons; in other words, [if] an amount of pigeonholes is more than an amount of pigeons, there is at least one empty pigeonhole.

*** Learning sample:

To prove that in any choice of 5 dots inside of the unit square (r = 1) there is a pair of dots are located from one another no more than (sqrt2)/2.

P: A diagonal of the unit square equals sqrt2. Then, if we divide the square into 4 equal squares (pigeonholes on the Dirichlet principle) and put 5 dots inside of the big square randomly, we will one pigeonhole w/ more than 2 dots absolutely. A diagonal of each square pigeonhole is (sqrt2)/2; so, the max. distance between 2 dots inside of each square pigeonhole is no more than a diagonal ((sqrt2)/2).


Perturbations.

Perturbation of an array consisting of n el. is an ordered set of all array el. 

Number of perturbations of an array (of n el.) [is denoted as p(n)] - a number of dif. perturbations of an array.

123
*()
*)(
()*
(*)
)*(
)(*

Formula: Pn = n!

Perturbations w repetitions.

Formula: P(n1,..,nk) = n!/(n1!,..,nk!)

*** Learning sample:

How many perturbations exist in the "Mississippi" word?

S: m = 1, i = 4, s = 4, p = 2 -> N = 11. Thus, P(1,4,4,2) = 11!/(1!4!4!2!) = 34650.


Arrangements and Combinations (General Information)

Arrangements - order of el. is important.
Combinations - .. not important.

A. n C. can be w/(out) repetitions.
"Without repetitons" is a subset of "with repetitions".

Arrangements.

Let there be an array of n el. An ordered set of some array el. m is named as arrangement of n el. at m w/out repetitions. 
Let denote num. of arrangements as A^m_n. 
How to find A^m_n? 
Theorem.
A^m_n = n(n-1)..(n-m+1) = n!/(n-m)!
Proof - we have n possible ways to select the 1st el., n-1 possible ways to select the 2nd one, etc. Finally, we've got m factors starting from n and decreasing at 1 every time.
* A^n_n = Pn
* ^-A^k_n = n^k (^- means A w/ repetitions)

*** Learning sample:

There is a list of arrangements from 5 el. at 3 el. taken from the array {a,b,c,d,e}. The num. of arrangements should be equal to 5*4*3 = 60; this is as it follows below:

abc bac cab dab eab
abd bad cad dac eac
abe bae cae dae ead
acb bca cba dba eba
acd bcd cbd dbc ebc
ace bce cbe dbe ebd
adb bda cda dca eca
adc bdc cdb dcb ecb
ade bde cde dce ecd
aeb bea cea dea eda
aec bec ceb deb edb
aed bed ced dec edc

If these arrangements are grouped into the same letters content categories, we get the 10 rows (in each row there are 6 el.):

abc acb bac bca cab cba - {a,b,c} 
abd adb bad bda dab dba - {a,b,d}
abe aeb bae bea eab eba - {a,b,e}
acd adc cad cda dac dca - {a,c,d}
ace aec cae cea eac eca - {a,c,e}
ade aed dae dea ead eda - {a,d,e}
bcd bdc cbd cdb dbc dcb - {b,c,d}
bce bec cbe ceb ebc ecb - {b,c,e}
bde bed dbe deb ebd edb - {d,e,b}
cde ced dce dec ecd edc - {c,d,e}


Combinations.

Let there be an array of n el. An unordered set of some array el. m is named as combination of n el. at m w/out repetitions.
Let denote a set of combinations of n el. as C^m_n.
The relation between A^m_n, C^m_n: C^m_n = A^m_n / m! = n!/[(n-m)!m!].
* ^-C^m_n = C^m_[n+m-1] (^- means C w/ repetitions)
Proof - Let there be an array of n el. {a,b,c..l}, in which every el. may repeat A,B,C..L times (A+B+C..+L=m):
a,a..a, b,b..b, c,c..c, l,l..l
Let denote both all el. as "1" and the spaces between various el. as "0" as it follows:
1,1..1,0,1,1..1,0,1,1..1,0,1,1..1 - this combination consists of 1 (the all m el. w/ repetitions) and 0 (=n-1 [cause 0s separate n {a,b,c..l} elements between them]). 
In other words, this combination is sum of m and (n-1) and C^m_[n+m-1] = (n+m-1)!/[(n-1)!m!]
Consequences:
* C^[n-m]_n = n!/[(n-m)!(n(n-m))!]
* C^m_n = C^[m-1]_[n-1] + C^m_[n-1]
* C^0_n = 1
* C^1_n = n
* C^m_n for negative m = C^m_n = 0


Newton's binomial theorem.

The following formula is true for any n:
(a+b)^n = sum^n_[k=0]:C^k_n*a^k*b^[n-k]
Proof - (based on the principle of mathematical induction). The concept is clearly shown for n = 1. Let assume it is also proved for n-1 and we should suggest it for n. We have:
(a+b)^n = (a+b)(a+b)^[n-1] = (a+b)sum^[n-1]_[k=0]:C^k_[n-1]*a^[k]*b^[n-1-k] = sum^[n-1]_[k=0]:C^k_[n-1]*a^[k+1]*b^[n-k-1] +
+ sum^[n-1]_[k=0]:C^k_[n-1]*a^k*b^[n-k] = sum^[n-1]_[k=0]:(C^[k-1]_[n-1] + C^k_[n-1])*a^k*b^[n-k] = sum^[n]_[k=0]:C^k_n*a^k*b^[n-k] =
= sum^[n]_[k=0]:C^k_n*a^k*b^[n-k].
p.s. C^k_n is denoted is binomial coefficient. p.s.* In the theorem the binomial coef-s. simplest feature is used: C^[k-1]_[n-1] + C^k_[n-1] = C^k_n.


Pascal's triangle.

Binomial coef. may be represented in a triangle view in which each value (except the first one) is the sum of 2 former ones. This triangle is named as Pascal's triangle.

Newton's Binomial. Formulas of combinatorics.

* If a = 1, b = 1, the binomial formula is expressed as:
2^n = sum^n_[k=0] = C^k_n
* If a = 1, b = -1, the binomial formula ..:
0 = C^0_n - C^1_n + C^2_n - C^3_n + ..

*** Learning sample:

Find num. of combinations from 10 el. at 3 el. (imagine an entrance lock) when:
a) num. may repeat
b) num. cannot repeat

S: a) C^3_10 = 10!/[3!7!] = 120 combinations; b) ^-C^3_10 = C^3_12 = 12!/[3!9!] = 220 combinations.

*** Learning sample:

Draw Pascal's triangle and prove the values located inside of it are binomial coef-s.

S: Let draw Pascal's triangle in this way:
 
(a+b)^n - Newton's binomial:
(a+b)^n = (a+b)(a+b)..(a+b)n

n = 0  1        
n = 1  1 1
n = 2  1 2 1
n = 3  1 3 3 1
n = 4  1 4 6 4 1

For instance, for the second row (n = 1..) if the right "1" has coordinates (m,n), the left "1" - (m,n-1) and the upper left "1" (in the row n = 0..) - (m-1,n-1).
Thus, the values in the triangle may be represented as binomial coef. based on the binomial coef-s. simplest feature: C^[m-1]_[n-1] + C^m_[n-1] = C^m_n.

*** Learning sample:

Prove using the binomial formula that the alternating sum of binomial coef-s equals 0.

P: Using reverse logic - 0 = (1-1)^n = sum^n_[k=0]:C^k_n*1^[k]*(-1)^[n-k] = C^0_n - C^1_n + C^2_n - C^3_n + .. (-1)^n*C^n_n


Stars and bars method. De Moivre's task.

This is the case when:
1) the problem may be represented as finding solutions of x1 + x2 + .. + xk = n in integer numbers (btw each xi >= 0);
2) we have k same objects that should be put in n stacks.

The formula we should use is C^[n-1]_[n+k-1] to solve De Moivre's task.

*** Learning sample:

How many ways to put k same balls in n boxes? Boxes differ from each other.

S: k = 5, n = 3.
* - a box, | - a partition, then: *****|| 5 balls n 2 partitions; so, there are 7 positions, we need to decide where to put partitions, for example:

**|**|*
*|**|**
***|*|*

The formula we should use - C^[n-1]_[n+k-1] = C^2_[5+2] = C^2_7 = 7!/2!5! = 21 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes.

(0,1)(1,1)(2,1)
(0,0)(1,0)(2,0)

General formulas: T(a+1,b+1) = T(a,b+1) + T(a,b) + T(a+1,b); T(a,0) = T(0,b) = 1.

T(1,0) = T(0,1) = 1
