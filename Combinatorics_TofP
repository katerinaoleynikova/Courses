# Lecture 1: Elements of Combinatorics. /06 Sept. 2021/
The main rules of combinatorics: rule of sum and rule of multiplication. Factorial. Arrangements, Replacements, Combinations, Combinations with repetitions. Newton's binomial theorem.


The rule of sum:

Let an object a be from A = {a1, a2, ... an} that could be selected by n dif. ways, and another obj. b from B = {b1, b2, ... bn} could be selected by m ways. Then, there are n+m ways to select an obj. a or an obj. b.

*** Learning sample:

How many ways to select a student in a group consisting of A boys and B girls?

Solution: We may select a student from two cohorts: A (boys) or B (girls). "Or" is the same as "plus", therefore, A + B is the correct answer.


The rule of multiplication:

Let an obj. A would be selected by n ways, and then after such a choice an obj. B would be selected by m ways too. Then, a duet (A,B) could be selected by n*m ways.

*** Learning sample:

It is needed to find a num. of words that contain no more than 3 letters from {A,T,G,C}.

S: "No more than" means "less or equal". In this case, the range of our choice is 1 or 2 or 3 letters: when 1 letter - A, T, G, C; when 2 letters - AA, AT, AG, ... CC; when 3 letters - AAA, AAT, ATT, ... CCC. So, we may write it mathematically as it follows:
4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 = 84 words.
P.S. for instance, 4^1 means number of 1 letter words from 4 possible letters (A,T,G,C), 4^2 - number of 2 letter words from 4 possible letters (AA,AT,AG..), etc.

*** Learning sample:

How many five-digit numbers do exist?

S: ***** - a five-digit number. The first * can be in the range {1-9}, the other ones - in the range {0,9}. Thus, n = 9*10^4, where n - a number of five-digit num-s.


Dirichlet's principle or Pigeonhole principle:

Let there are n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, then there is at least one pigeonhole w/ 2 or more pigeons; in other words, [if] an amount of pigeonholes is more than an amount of pigeons, there is at least one empty pigeonhole.

*** Learning sample:

To prove that in any choice of 5 dots inside of the unit square (r = 1) there is a pair of dots are located from one another no more than (sqrt2)/2.

P: A diagonal of the unit square equals sqrt2. Then, if we divide the square into 4 equal squares (pigeonholes on the Dirichlet principle) and put 5 dots inside of the big square randomly, we will one pigeonhole w/ more than 2 dots absolutely. A diagonal of each square pigeonhole is (sqrt2)/2; so, the max. distance between 2 dots inside of each square pigeonhole is no more than a diagonal ((sqrt2)/2).


Perturbations.

Perturbation of an array consisting of n el. is an ordered set of all array el. 

Number of perturbations of an array (of n el.) [is denoted as p(n)] - a number of dif. perturbations of an array.

Formula: Pn = n!

Perturbations w repetitions.

Formula: P(n1,..,nk) = n!/(n1!,..,nk!)

*** Learning sample:

How many perturbations exist in the "Mississippi" word?

S: m = 1, i = 4, s = 4, p = 2 -> N = 11. Thus, P(1,4,4,2) = 11!/(1!4!4!2!) = 34650.


Arrangements and Combinations (General Information)

Arrangements - order of el. is important.
Combinations - .. not important.

A. n C. can be w/(out) repetitions.
"Without repetitons" is a subset of "with repetitions".

Arrangements.

Let there is an array of n el. An ordered set of some array el. m is named as arrangement of n el. at m w/out repetitions. 
Let denote num. of arrangements as A^m_n. 
How to find A^m_n? 
Theorem.
A^m_n = n(n-1)..(n-m+1) = n!/(n-m)!
Proof - we have n possible ways to select the 1st el., n-1 possible ways to select the 2nd one, etc. Finally, we've got m factors starting from n and decreasing at 1 every time.
* A^n_n = Pn
* ^-A^k_n = n^k (^- means A w/ repetitions)

*** Learning sample:

There is a list of arrangements from 5 el. at 3 el. taken from the array {a,b,c,d,e}. The num. of arrangements should be equal to 5*4*3 = 60; this is as it follows below:

abc bac cab dab eab
abd bad cad dac eac
abe bae cae dae ead
acb bca cba dba eba
acd bcd cbd dbc ebc
ace bce cbe dbe ebd
adb bda cda dca eca
adc bdc cdb dcb ecb
ade bde cde dce ecd
aeb bea cea dea eda
aec bec ceb deb edb
aed bed ced dec edc

If these arrangements are grouped into the same letters content categories, we get the 10 rows (in each row there are 6 el.):

abc acb bac bca cab cba - {a,b,c} 
abd adb bad bda dab dba - {a,b,d}
abe aeb bae bea eab eba - {a,b,e}
acd adc cad cda dac dca - {a,c,d}
ace aec cae cea eac eca - {a,c,e}
ade aed dae dea ead eda - {a,d,e}
bcd bdc cbd cdb dbc dcb - {b,c,d}
bce bec cbe ceb ebc ecb - {b,c,e}
bde bed dbe deb ebd edb - {d,e,b}
cde ced dce dec ecd edc - {c,d,e}

Combinations.

Let there is an array of n el. An unordered set of some array el. m is named as combination of n el. at m w/out repetitions.
Let denote a set of combinations of n el. as C^m_n.
The relation between A^m_n, C^m_n: C^m_n = A^m_n / m! = n!/[(n-m)!m!].
* ^-C^m_n = C^m_[n+m-1] (^- means C w/ repetitions)
