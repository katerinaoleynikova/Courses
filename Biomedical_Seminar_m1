* How to compare the two words: actgc, ctagg?

actgc  a|c|t|_|g|c
ctagg  _|c|t|a|g|g

where "_" - deletions, |_| - insertions (of a, for instance), |c| - replacements.
                       |a|                                    |g|

Case study sample: two proteins that should be compared and analyzed (their structures, relations, etc.).

So, it is important to formalize a biological task.

The reviewed task is named as "alignment" by biologists, "minimization of editorial distances" by mathematicians.

* Alignment can be:
- local or global
- pairwise or multiple.

Case study sample 1: pairwise alignment is used when two seqs exist.
Case study sample 2: local alignemnt is used when we want to compare pieces of DNA (for instance, hundreds bp).
For example, there is a seq consisting of 1B bp. It is needed to find almost the same seqs (the length for each seq is nearly two hundreds bp).
This is very difficult task to solve; thus, it is rarely common.
Case study sample 3: multiple alignment sample - there are 20 proteins instead of 2 ones.
Case study sample 4: global alignment sample - when we want to compare whole seqs.

* Deletions, insertions, replacements may be caused by biological errors (in any biological processes).

* How to find an appropriate alignment? p.s. means w/ a min cost of the editorial operations.
It is possible by use of a graph.
